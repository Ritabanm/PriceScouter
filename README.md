# PriceScouter
PriceScouter is a cross-platform mobile app built with react native and a whole lot of love. 

## Key Features for V1.0
  * Object detector
  * Price Estimator (Using user input for object condition, warranty and age).

## Limitations:
  * Object detection is limited to the mobile net default classes for now.
  * Pricing model based on naive mathematical calculations.


## Future Scope/ Product Roadmap:

  * Fine-tuned image classifier for identifying and evaluating pricing based on brands.
  * Improved coverage for more common product categories (currently only supports electronics).
  * In-app marketplace.
